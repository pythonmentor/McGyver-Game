<h1>McGyver maze game</h1>
<h2>Why this program?</h2>
<p> This game is a 2D labyrinth in which MacGyver has been locked up. The exit is supervised by a bodyguard whose hair would turn Tina Turner pale. To distract, you need to gather the following elements (scattered in the labyrinth): a needle, a small plastic tube and ether. They will allow MacGyver to create a syringe and lull our guard to go out of the labyrinth. The technical library used Pygame. This game is a practical application of the Openclassrooms App Developer in Python course. The skills mobilized:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Read and understand a module documentation </ li>
     <li> Manage different versions of Python and its modules according to projects </ li>
     <li> Create scripts for the web using Python </ li>
     <li> Use an algorithm to solve a technical need </ li>
     <li> Code effectively using the right tools </ li>
     <li> Conceptualize the whole of its application by describing its structure (Entities / Domain Objects)</li>
</ul>
